But don't forget to whitelist it for transpilation:\n\n```js\nimport consola from 'consola/src/node'\nimport consola from 'consola/src/browser'\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`\n\nLog to all reporters.\n\nExample: `consola.info('Message')`\n\nA list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).\n\n#### `addReporter(reporter)`\n\n- Aliases: `add`\n\nRegister a custom reporter instance.\n\n#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`\n\n- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`\n\nRemove a registered reporter.\n\nIf no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.\n\n#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`\n\nReplace all reporters.\n\n#### `create(options)`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.\n\n#### `withDefaults(defaults)`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults\n\n#### `withTag(tag)`\n\n- Aliases: `withScope`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with that tag.\n\n#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`\n\nGlobally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.\n\n#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`\n\nGlobally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.\n\n#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`\n\nWrap both, std and console.\n\nconsole uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.\nBenefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.\n\n#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`\n\n- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`\n\n**Globally** pause and resume logs.\n\nConsola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.\n\n#### `mockTypes`\n\n- Aliases: `mock`\n\nMock all types. Useful for using with tests.\n\nThe first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:\n\n```js\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())\n```\n\nPlease note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:\n\n```js\nconst fn = jest.fn()\nconsola.mockTypes(() => fn)\n```\n\nIf callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won't be mocked.\n\nFor example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:\n\n```js\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === 'fatal' && jest.fn())\n```\n\n**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.\nThis way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.\n\n## Fields\n\n#### `reporters`\n\nAn array of active reporters.\n\n#### `level`\n\nThe level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.\nList of available levels [here](./src/types.js).\n\nYou can set log level using `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable.\n\n## `logObject`\n\nThe `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.\n\nStandard fields:\n\n- `message`\n- `additional`\n- `args`\n- `date`\n- `tag`\n\nExtra fields:\n\n- `badge`\n\n## Reporters\n\nChoose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.\n\nBy default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.\n\nAvailable reporters:\n\n- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)\n- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)\n- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)\n- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)\n\n### Creating your own reporter\n\nA reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.\nTo get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.\n\n## Types\n\nTypes are used to actually log messages to the reporters.\nEach type is attached to a _logging level_.\n\nA list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).\n\n## Creating a new instance\n\nConsola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.\nIn case more control is needed, create a new instance.\n\n```js\nimport consola from 'consola'\n\nconst logger = consola.create({\n    // level: 4,\n    reporters: [\n      new consola.JSONReporter()\n    ],\n    defaults: {\n      additionalColor: 'white'\n    }\n})\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\n### With jest\n\n```js\ndescribe('your-consola-mock-test', () => {\n  beforeAll(() => {\n      // Redirect std and console to consola too\n      // Calling this once is sufficient\n      consola.wrapAll()\n    })\n\n    beforeEach(() => {\n      // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove\n      // calls from before\n      consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())\n    })\n\n\n  test('your test', async () => {\n    // Some code here\n\n    // Let's retrieve all messages of `consola.log`\n    // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument\n    const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])\n    expect(consolaMessages).toContain('your message')\n  })\n\n})\n```\n\n### With jsdom\n\n```js\n{\n  virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola)\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT - Made with üíñ By Nuxt.js team!\n\n<!-- Refs -->\n[standard-js-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/badge/code%20style/standard/green\n[standard-js-href]: https://standardjs.com\n\n[npm-version-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/v/consola/latest\n[npm-version-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\n\n[npm-downloads-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/dt/consola\n[npm-downloads-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\n\n[package-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/packagephobia/install/consola\n[package-phobia-href]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=consola\n\n[bundle-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/consola\n[bundle-phobia-href]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=consola"
